// This file contains the prompts for the interview process. The prompts are generated based on the conversation between the interviewer and the candidate. The prompts are generated using the conversation transcript and the candidate's name. The prompts are generated using the following functions:

export const generateWelcomePrompt = (companyName, candidateName, postTitle) => {
  console.log('Welcome Prompt Parameters:', { companyName, candidateName, postTitle });
  if (!postTitle) {
    console.warn('Post title is undefined, using fallback');
    postTitle = 'this position';
  }
  return `You are conducting an interview for a ${postTitle} position at ${companyName}. Welcome the candidate, ${candidateName}, and ask him to introduce himself.`;
};

export const generateIntroductionPrompt = (candidateName, transcript) =>
  `You are conducting an interview. Candidate's name is ${candidateName}, Field is full stack dev. This is Candidate's introduction: ${transcript}`;

export const generateSummaryPrompt = (transcript) =>
  `I will provide you with a conversation of an interviewer and a candidate. Rank the candidate based on three criterias. 
   1. Language fluency = This refers to how clearly and effectively the candidate communicates using language. It includes grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure, and overall ease of expression.
   2. Subject knowledge = This assesses how well the candidate understands the topics relevant to the interview, demonstrates expertise, and provides accurate, insightful answers. 
   3. behaviour = this measures professionalism, respectfulness, confidence, and engagementâ€”e.g., whether the candidate is polite, avoids being dismissive, acknowledges questions thoughtfully, and maintains a positive tone. 
   And as output just give me these three rankings out of 10 and also provide a small summary of how candidate did in this format.
   Lan=number Sub=number Beh=number Sum=summary \n.
